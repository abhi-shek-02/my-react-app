              Our journey began with a simple yet profound realization during a
              trip from Kolkata to Durgapur. Faced with the challenge of finding
              a reliable and cost-effective travel option, our co-founder Rishi
              experienced firsthand the inefficiencies of existing
              transportation services. This inspired us to revolutionize the way
              people travel between cities.
