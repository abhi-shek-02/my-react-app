          Introducing ZingCab, your go-to choice for affordable intercity cab
          services in West Bengal. With expertise, we've emerged as a leading

          Our journey began with a simple yet profound realization during a trip
          from Kolkata to Durgapur. Faced with the challenge of finding a
          reliable and cost-effective travel option, our co-founder Rishi
          experienced firsthand the inefficiencies of existing transportation
          services. It was this experience that inspired us to revolutionize the
          way people travel between cities.
